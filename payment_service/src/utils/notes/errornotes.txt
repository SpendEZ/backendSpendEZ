Types of errors

Operation errors

Operational errors are the problems that we can predict that will happen at some point in the future. We need to handle them in advance.
- User trying to access invalid route.
- inputting invalid data.
- Application failed to connect to the server.
- Request timeout. 

Programing Errors

Programming errors are simply bugs that we programmers, by mistake, introduce them into out code.

- Trying to read property of an undefined variable.
- using await without async.
- Accidentally using req.query instead of req.body.
- Passing a number where an object is expected.
